# REM System — Release Notes

---

## [Unreleased — post-0.6.0]

### Summary
Current cycle focus is interface-first usability and runtime reliability.
The desktop shell and built-in browser UX were refined for easier daily use, while shutdown/runtime browser window behavior was hardened.
The browser strategy now has a documented compliance-first roadmap based on embedded browser engines rather than a custom rendering engine.

### Highlights
- **Desktop shell usability updates** — launcher categories, pinned behavior hardening, clearer power/user actions
- **Browser app UX updates** — homepage, in-app search home/results/page switching, minimized-results recovery
- **Users app logout action** — direct sign-out from Users surface
- **Dedicated WebUI window shutdown closure** — graceful shutdown closes the dedicated browser window and resets lock state
- **NekoCore Browser roadmap draft** — phased plan with legal/commercial guardrails and engine-based implementation path
- **334 passing tests** across unit and integration suites

### Current Direction
1. Prioritize interface clarity and intuitive app flows before deeper feature expansion.
2. Keep runtime/shutdown behavior predictable and safe.
3. Progress browser capability through an embedded-engine strategy with explicit copyright and safety guardrails.

### Legal and Community Safety Notes
1. Project remains MIT licensed for open and commercial use.
2. No bypass-oriented features should be implemented (DRM, paywall, CSP/frame restriction circumvention).
3. AI extraction and persistence should remain explicit and user-directed.

### Browser Dependency and Notices Policy (NB-0-2)
1. Browser dependencies now follow an approval checklist: license compatibility, maintenance/security health, required purpose, and notices readiness.
2. Third-party notice bundles are required for distributed browser artifacts.
3. Engine/runtime notice requirements must be included when using WebView2, CEF, Electron, or equivalent embedded-browser runtime.
4. Dependency additions for browser-host work must be reflected in release documentation.

### Browser Data Boundary Policy (NB-0-3)
1. Browser data and REM memory are now explicitly treated as separate stores.
2. Browser analysis defaults to ephemeral; no silent auto-ingest into REM memory.
3. Browser-to-memory writes require explicit user-directed action and confirmation.
4. Saved browser artifacts should include source attribution metadata when available.

### Browser Spike Acceptance Baseline (NB-1-0)
1. Technical acceptance checks are now defined for navigation, tab model invariants, lifecycle event visibility, and download event visibility.
2. Spike validation now requires an evidence package: pass/fail matrix, event-trace sample, and residual-risk notes.
3. Phase NB-1 remains active with NB-1-1 as the next slice (repo module boundaries).

### Browser Repo Module Boundary Baseline (NB-1-1)
1. Repo ownership boundaries are now defined for `browser-host/**`, `browser-shared/**`, `server/routes/browser-routes.js`, `server/services/browser/**`, and `client/js/browser/**`.
2. `server/server.js` is reaffirmed as composition-only for browser integration wiring.
3. Phase NB-1 remains active with NB-1-2 as the next slice (bridge/API contract list).

### Browser Bridge/API Contract Baseline (NB-1-2)
1. Initial endpoint set is now defined for browser session, tab state, and download state reads.
2. Initial command contracts are now defined for navigate, tab create/activate/close, and reload operations.
3. Event channel contracts are now defined for host lifecycle, tab lifecycle, navigation state, and download state.
4. Standard error envelope contracts are now defined for API and bridge/event failures.
5. NB-1 technical spike-prep slices are now complete.

### NekoCore Browser NB-2 Technical Spike Phase Opened (NB-2-0)
1. Phase NB-1 is closed (Done).
2. Phase NB-2 Technical Spike Implementation is now active with six slices: host scaffold, navigation POC, tab model POC, lifecycle/download events POC, backend bridge wiring, and spike acceptance run.
3. NB-2-1 (host module scaffold) is the first implementation slice.

### Breaking Changes
None. Existing entities continue to work. New features activate only when explicitly used.

## [0.5.2-prealpha] — 2026-03-11

### Highlights
- Parallel contributor pipeline live (1A + 1C + 1D)
- Multi-user support with user profile registry
- Per-user relationship system with 14-value feeling scale + trust/rapport tracking
- Relationship context injected into every subconscious pass

### What Is New

**Parallel Contributor Pipeline**
All three contributors — Subconscious (1A), Conscious (1C), Dream-Intuition (1D) — now run in parallel via `Promise.all`. This replaces the old serial Subconscious → Compress → Conscious flow. The Orchestrator then runs 2B refinement and a Final synthesis pass.

Pipeline per message:
```
1. 1A + 1C + 1D — parallel
2. Orchestrator 2B refinement
3. Orchestrator Final
4. [async] Memory encoding + relationship update
```

Total LLM calls: 5 synchronous + up to 2 async post-turn.

**Multi-User System**
Each entity now maintains its own registry of users it has met (`entities/<id>/memories/users/`). Episodic and semantic memories are stamped with `userId` and `userName`. Recalled memories render `[EXPERIENCE with user="X"]` in the subconscious context block.

User profile API (entity-routes.js):
```
GET/POST       /api/users
GET/POST/DELETE /api/users/active
PUT/DELETE     /api/users/:userId
```

**Per-User Relationship System**
After each chat turn, a fire-and-forget LLM call evolves the entity's relationship with the active user.

Tracked state: `feeling` (14-value scale: loathing → devoted), `trust` (0–1), `rapport` (0–1), `userRole`, `entityRole`, `beliefs[]`, `summary`, `changeReason`. Trust/rapport change bounded at ±0.08 per turn.

Context block rendered in subconscious:
```
[YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH "Alice"]
  Feeling: warm  ████████░░  Trust: 78%
  Role: friend / companion
  Beliefs: ["Alice is curious and philosophical"]
  Summary: Three months of collaborative work. Genuinely warm.
```

Relationship API (entity-routes.js):
```
GET /api/relationships
GET /api/relationships/active
GET /api/relationships/:userId
```

**Architecture**
- New: `server/brain/cognition/dream-intuition-adapter.js` — live 1D contributor (no memory writes)
- New: `server/brain/utils/turn-signals.js` — deterministic turn signal extraction
- New: `server/contracts/contributor-contracts.js` — output shape validators
- New: `server/brain/core/orchestration-policy.js` — initial escalation policy
- New: `server/services/user-profiles.js` — user registry management
- New: `server/services/relationship-service.js` — relationship state + LLM update
- New: `server/services/post-response-memory.js` — async post-turn side effects extracted
- New: `server/services/response-postprocess.js` — response cleanup extracted
- New: `server/services/runtime-lifecycle.js` — startup/shutdown extracted
- New: `tests/integration/orchestrator.test.js` — initial orchestrator integration suite
- New: `WORKLOG.md` — structured work tracking (phase checklists, ledger, stop/resume)

**Breaking Changes:** None. Existing entities work unchanged. New features activate only with a user profile set active.

## [0.5.1-prealpha] — 2026-03-10

### Highlights
- Timeline logger and playback in neural visualizer
- Memory write safety (atomic write strategy)
- Memory index divergence audit and rebuild tooling
- Brain-loop health counters and circuit-breaker diagnostics

### What Is New

**Timeline Logger**
`server/services/timeline-logger.js` records all cognitive events (thoughts, chat, memory, traces) as chronological NDJSON.
- `GET /api/timeline` — retrieve recorded events
- `GET /api/timeline/stream` — live event stream

**Timeline Playback**
New panel in the neural visualizer with transport controls: play/pause/stop, step, rewind/fast-forward, speed control, live mode. Space key toggles play/pause when Timeline tab is active.

**Memory Write Safety**
Atomic write strategy applied to core memory and index persistence paths:
1. Write payload to temporary file
2. Rename to target file
Reduces partial-write corruption risk on interruption.

**Memory Index Divergence**
`auditIndex()` compares disk state vs cached index state and reports: diskCount, indexCount, missingInIndex, staleInIndex, diverged. `rebuildFromDisk()` reconstructs index from actual filesystem state.

**Brain Loop Diagnostics**
Health counters and circuit-breaker status now tracked in `brain-loop-state.json`. Loop can self-detect hung states and surface diagnostics via API.

**Browser Auto-Open Guard**
`server/services/auto-open-browser.js` prevents duplicate browser windows on quick server restarts.

## [0.5.0-prealpha] — 2026-03-09

### Highlights
- Pixel art generation from dream/memory narratives
- Dream Gallery UI tab
- Boredom Engine (autonomous activity when understimulated)
- Neural Visualizer standalone 3D page
- Belief Graph, Neurochemistry Engine, Somatic Awareness Engine

### What Is New

**Neko-Pixel-Pro Pixel Art Engine**
Generates 64×64 pixel art from dream and memory narratives. Maps keywords to a handcrafted vocabulary of 85+ terms and 200+ synonyms, renders shape-based scenes with emotion-driven palettes. Compiled into animated GIFs per dream cycle. Optional dependency (`@napi-rs/canvas`, `gif-encoder-2`).

**Dream Gallery**
New UI tab displaying all dream visualization cycles. Refresh, manual generation trigger, per-dream modal viewer.

**Boredom Engine**
Detects understimulation (idle time + low dopamine/oxytocin) and triggers autonomous activity: creative writing, workspace organization, self-reflection, reaching out to user, goal review. Weight-based selection with history tracking avoids repetition.

**Belief Graph**
`server/beliefs/beliefGraph.js` — beliefs form from 3+ semantic memories on a shared topic. Confidence rises (+0.05) with reinforcement and falls (−0.10) with contradiction. Active beliefs boost retrieval scores for related topics (+0.20 × confidence).

**Neurochemistry Engine**
Simulates dopamine, cortisol, serotonin, oxytocin. Drifts toward baseline, nudged by 20+ cognitive bus events. Drives emotional tagging, Hebbian co-activation reinforcement, weak connection pruning.

**Somatic Awareness Engine**
Maps hardware metrics (CPU, RAM, disk) and cognitive metrics (latency, context fullness, decay rate, error rate) into natural-language felt sensations and neurochemical influence vectors.

**Neural Visualizer**
Standalone `client/visualizer.html` with Three.js 3D memory graph, orbit controls, chat panel, memory browser, and diagnostics.
