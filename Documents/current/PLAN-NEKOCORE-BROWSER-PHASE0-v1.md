# PLAN: NekoCore Browser Phase 0 Baseline

**Status:** `In Progress`
**Version target:** 0.6.x
**Date created:** 2026-03-14
**Last updated:** 2026-03-14

---

## 1. Background / Why This Plan Exists

NekoCore is moving from REM System core capability into the NekoCore OS phase. Browser capability is currently limited by iframe constraints and cannot reliably support blocked sites or full browser behavior. Before writing host code, we need a compliance and architecture baseline that protects open-source contributors and commercial adopters. This plan turns the browser roadmap into actionable Phase 0 execution slices.

---

## 2. Objective

Define and approve the legal, architecture, contribution, and data-handling baseline for NekoCore Browser so implementation can begin safely. Done means we have an approved Phase 0 policy package, explicit non-goals, dependency review policy, browser data policy, and contribution policy decision (DCO or CLA). This phase does not build the browser host yet; it removes ambiguity and prevents compliance drift.

---

## 3. Audit Findings / Pre-Work Analysis

| Item | Current Location | Lines | Problem / Note | Target |
|------|-----------------|-------|----------------|--------|
| Browser strategy draft | `NEKOCORE-BROWSER-ROADMAP.md` | ~320 | Roadmap exists but no executable phase plan/checklist | `Documents/current/PLAN-NEKOCORE-BROWSER-PHASE0-v1.md` |
| Vision phase framing | `Documents/current/VISION-AND-ROADMAP.md` | n/a | NekoCore phase clarified, but no implementation runbook for browser kickoff | Phase 0 slice execution + WORKLOG ledger |
| Documentation policy | `WORKLOG.md` | n/a | Policy requires planned docs before coding; this enables phase-compliant start | Phase 0 in-progress ledger entry |

**Estimated total impact:** 3 to 6 documentation/policy files updated, no runtime code impact in Phase 0.

---

## 4. Architecture Boundary Check

- [x] No frontend (`client/**`) receives backend orchestration, filesystem logic, or policy logic
- [x] No backend (`server/**`) receives DOM/UI rendering concerns
- [x] New routes added to `server/routes/**`, not inlined into `server/server.js`
- [x] New data schemas and validators go into `server/contracts/**`
- [x] No new business logic added to `server/server.js` (composition only)
- [x] All new modules target <= 300 lines where practical
- [x] Any file above 1200 lines that needs changes: extraction is required in the same slice

Phase 0 is docs/policy only, but boundaries are pre-confirmed for the next implementation phase.

---

### NB-1-0 — Spike Acceptance Checks Baseline

**Start criteria:** NB-0-5 done and Phase NB-1 active.

**Work:**
1. Define acceptance checks for navigation behavior on an embedded-engine host.
2. Define tab model invariants for create/switch/close and active-tab continuity.
3. Define lifecycle event visibility requirements for host and tab surfaces.
4. Define download event visibility and minimum metadata requirements.
5. Define required spike evidence package for pass/fail handoff.

**Boundary markers:** `[BOUNDARY_OK]` `[CONTRACT_ENFORCED]`

**Acceptance checks (must all pass):**

1. Navigation checks
	- Can navigate to explicit `https://` URL input.
	- Back/forward/refresh commands operate on the active tab.
	- Navigation failures produce explicit error state (not silent no-op).
2. Tab model checks
	- New tab creates a unique tab id and sets active tab deterministically.
	- Close-tab updates active tab deterministically (next, else previous, else none).
	- Switching tabs updates address/title/loading indicators to selected tab state.
3. Lifecycle checks
	- Host emits lifecycle states: `host_starting`, `host_ready`, `host_closing`.
	- Tab emits lifecycle states: `tab_created`, `tab_navigating`, `tab_ready`, `tab_closed`.
	- Unexpected termination/crash path emits explicit error event with reason.
4. Download visibility checks
	- Download start event is emitted with download id, source URL, and suggested filename when available.
	- Download completion/failure events are emitted and correlated to the same id.
	- Download events are visible to shell/task surfaces (telemetry visibility), even before final UI polish.
5. Evidence package checks
	- Spike run log with timestamped pass/fail per acceptance check.
	- Event trace sample showing navigation/tab/lifecycle/download events.
	- Short residual-risk note for any partial behavior accepted for NB-1.

**End criteria:**
- Acceptance checks are documented and approved in source-of-truth docs.
- NB-1-0 marked complete.
- NB-1-1 becomes active.

Files changed (expected):
- `Documents/current/PLAN-NEKOCORE-BROWSER-PHASE0-v1.md`
- `NEKOCORE-BROWSER-ROADMAP.md`
- `Documents/current/CONTRACTS-AND-SCHEMAS.md`
- `Documents/current/RELEASE-NOTES.md`

### NB-1-1 — Repo Module Boundary Map

**Start criteria:** NB-1-0 done.

**Work:**
1. Define browser host ownership boundary and runtime responsibilities.
2. Define shared contract/schema boundary for host-backend state exchange.
3. Define backend route boundary for browser-facing APIs.
4. Define policy boundary to prevent browser feature logic from leaking into composition/bootstrap modules.

**Boundary markers:** `[BOUNDARY_OK]` `[JS_OFFLOAD]` `[CONTRACT_ENFORCED]`

**Boundary map (authoritative for NB-1):**

1. `browser-host/**` (new module root)
	- Owns embedded-engine runtime lifecycle, window/tab primitives, navigation execution, and host event emission.
	- Must not contain REM memory writes, entity orchestration logic, or route handlers.
2. `browser-shared/**` (new module root)
	- Owns serializable contracts for tab/session/download/lifecycle events and request payload schemas.
	- Must remain engine-agnostic and UI-agnostic.
3. `server/routes/browser-routes.js` (new route module)
	- Owns HTTP API surface for browser state queries and explicit command requests.
	- Must delegate business behavior to service modules; no embedded host logic.
4. `server/services/browser/**` (new service area)
	- Owns backend-side browser orchestration adapters and policy checks.
	- Must not render UI and must not become route/controller code.
5. `client/js/browser/**` (new UI area)
	- Owns browser shell UI state and user interaction wiring.
	- Must not contain filesystem logic, host process management, or backend business policy.
6. `server/server.js`
	- Composition/bootstrap only; may register browser routes and initialize browser service wiring.
	- Must not host browser business logic blocks.

**End criteria:**
- Module boundary map documented in source-of-truth docs.
- Ownership and non-ownership rules are explicit for each layer.
- NB-1-1 marked complete.
- NB-1-2 becomes active.

Files changed (expected):

2. Define command payload contracts for navigate, tab create/switch/close, and refresh actions.

3. Event channels
	- `browser.host.lifecycle`: `{ state, timestamp, reason? }`.
	- `browser.tab.lifecycle`: `{ tabId, state, timestamp, url?, title? }`.
	- `browser.navigation.state`: `{ tabId, url, loading, canGoBack, canGoForward, timestamp }`.
	- `browser.download.state`: `{ downloadId, state, timestamp, url?, suggestedFilename?, bytesReceived?, totalBytes? }`.
4. Error envelope
	- HTTP/API errors return `{ ok: false, code, message, requestId, retryable }`.
	- Bridge event errors include `{ scope, code, message, requestId?, timestamp }`.

**End criteria:**
- Initial bridge/API contract list documented in source-of-truth docs.

## 7. Test Plan

| Test File | Slice | What It Verifies |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| n/a (docs phase) | NB-0-* | Policy and scope baseline finalized before code |

**Test-first rule:** For the next code phase (NB-1), create guard checks for module boundaries and integration seams before host implementation begins.

---

## 8. Risk Notes

1. **Scope creep risk** — Browser feature implementation could begin before policy lock. Mitigation: block Phase NB-1 until NB-0-5 is done.
2. **Legal ambiguity risk** — Contributors may implement bypass-style features without explicit non-goals. Mitigation: enforce non-goals in roadmap and release docs.
3. **Data boundary risk** — Browser extraction could silently leak into REM memory. Mitigation: explicit consent rules and policy-defined persistence defaults.
